## Components

The Admin Dashboard is built using several reusable components:

- `Overview`: The main dashboard component displaying summary metrics.
- `UserMetrics`: Detailed user statistics and growth charts.
- `ContentAnalytics`: In-depth analysis of content performance and moderation.
- `EngagementInsights`: Visualization of user engagement and interaction data.
- `BlockchainMonitor`: Tracking of blockchain-related activities and token distribution.

Each component is designed to be modular and can be easily customized or extended as needed.

## API

The dashboard interacts with a backend API to fetch and display data. The main API functions are located in `lib/api.js`. Key functions include:

- `fetchDashboardData()`: Retrieves all dashboard metrics.
- `fetchUserData(timeRange)`: Fetches user-specific data for a given time range.
- `fetchContentData(timeRange)`: Retrieves content metrics for a specified period.
- `fetchEngagementData(timeRange)`: Gets engagement statistics for a particular timeframe.
- `fetchBlockchainData(timeRange)`: Fetches blockchain-related metrics for the specified duration.

Refer to the API documentation for detailed information on request/response formats and available endpoints.
